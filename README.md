Basically just a script to get [brew](https://brew.sh) up and running and a brewfile for it, containing all those things needed to do stuff your :computer:.

## Usage

Clone repository and run the `install.sh`script.
It will check whether [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) is set as default shell and if needed set it as default. 
Therefore you'll have to logout and rerun the script again after login.

## Customizing

Add the needed formula to the brewfile and rerun the script or run `brew bundle install` manually from the repository directory.
